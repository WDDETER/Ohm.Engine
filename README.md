# Ohm.Engine
A minimal engine, focused on software rendering for the game Ohm.

It is Windows only, since it directly talks to the WinAPI, so Mac or Linux is not supported.

The idea of the engine is to target folks with lower-spec hardware, and I mean very-low spec.
Or enable developers with only CPUs to make 3D graphical applications. The engine is not meant to be
archaic in anyway. I wanted to take on a more fun-to-type and open API. It is our engine.
